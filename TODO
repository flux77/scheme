TODO File for Schemy

* Add options when opening file for the action when the file exists 
  (like OCREAT| OTRUNC ...)
* Make the heaps extensible on demand
* garbage collect non longer used symbols (add a pass after marking)
* rewrite CHANNEL system so that blocking on write do not resend the complete
  buffer but only what is missing
* condition overhaul, make it more like record with define-condition-type
* program a THREAD-INTERRUPT! procedure that executes a THUNK within an 
  existing thread.
* should move all io function to scheme-posix

POSIX

* Socket should handle error better (two accept on the same port should in
  particular signal a condition)

BUGS

* (let-fluid $current-output-port$ 1 (lambda () (error "123")))
  produces a lot of "Reloc table full!" message and leads to a core
